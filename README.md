# CS-350

Before answering the following questions, I uploaded two projects which showed improvement in understanding how to utilize and code the interupts and statemachines.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The first project was an LED system that blinked morse code (SOS) and on a button interupt, blinked different morse code (OK).
The second project was a temperature system simulating wi-fi connectivity. This system read the current room temperature and when a button interupt was pressed, the set temperature for the thermostat would increase. If the temperature was less than the setpoint, then an LED would turn on indicating heating would occur to reach the setpoint.

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well was improve how I understood implementing statemachines and utilizing interupt flags. I believe the second project was much more readable and utilized state machines and interupts in a cleaner and more understandle way.

Where could you improve?
I could improve in my understanding of the underlying system. Often the given implemented functions (which may be out-of-scope for the course) felt a bit foreign to myself. However I achieved functionality, but improving this knowledge may have led to creating a more efficient system, which is important in embedded development.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I gained plenty of knowledge about microcontrollers and embedded systems from the course. Working with embedded systems and understanding their limitations. I got a closer look at working directly with embedded systems and how to learn to program for embedded systems, through understanding their specs and functions.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Anytime I deal with embedded technology, or work with C/C++ code, these skills will transfer well. These skills could include researching embedded systems, working with memory in embedded systems, and overall writing code for statemachines and understanding how to utilize timers and interrupts within embedded systems.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I followed certain examples and read through documentation, and then proceeded to follow standards and syntax from those examples.
